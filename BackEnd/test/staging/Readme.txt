Staging tests can be done on a testnet (LAST STOP!!)

Description : 
Staging environments test on a near-production level in a non-production environment and can lead
 to further confidence in the software when in production. Staging environments conduct tests 
 that prevent problems in production and thwart poor performance for the end user.
